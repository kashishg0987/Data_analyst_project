# Customer Segmentation using Python

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using data analysis and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their behavior and purchasing patterns,
which can help businesses improve marketing strategies and decision-making.

## Dataset
- customers.csv
- The dataset contains customer-related information used for segmentation analysis.

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and understanding
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature selection and scaling
5. Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
6. Visualization of customer segments
7. Interpretation of results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure customers.csv is in the same folder as the notebook
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Output
- Clustered customer segments
- Visual plots showing customer groups
- Insights useful for targeted marketing strategies

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how customer data can be analyzed and segmented using clustering techniques to derive meaningful business sights.
